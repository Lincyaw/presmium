Animations on the steps and on the lecture's time. The new plugin `@lincyaw/addon-motion` adds `{scene}`: a timeline of the document's `scenes/` written with GSAP, Anime.js, Motion, Three.js or Remotion, cut into steps by `:durations:`. The host gains the time in a step (`useStepTime`, driven by the page or by a lecture through `STEP_CLOCK`) and components' named actions (`useActions`), which replay the `click` of a lecture. A component node can declare `durations`, and a synthesized lecture stays on a step until its animations have played. `presmium-lecture export` draws the animations frame by frame at 30 frames a second by default, adds a WebVTT subtitle track for each language of the captions and writes them next to the video, and `--burn <language>` draws the captions on the picture. The guidance cursor glides on the step's time, so videos show it moving. Inside a slide, the slides host's `useCursor` gives that slide and its clicks, so a preview of the next slide stays settled. The renderers give a component node's `durations` to its component as the prop `durations`.
