### Minor Changes

- c5cbc1c: The official plugins are renamed from `@lincyaw/slidev-addon-*` to `@lincyaw/addon-*`. A headmatter or an operator plugin list that still names a plugin the old way loads the renamed package; `presmium check` says the current name once for each (an `info` of `presmium.plugins`), and the IR lists the current names.
- 672d5e5: Unify the viewer, web shell, host and plugin components on React with external stores and shared React modules. Replace the Vue runtime and component sources, including generated plugin projects and examples.
  
  Add a lazy BlockNote body editor with source-preserving MyST saves and explicit narration blocks. Text pages, animation blocks and step narration share the preview protocol; narration timing and animation step navigation remain available during presentation.
- afda9e9: The slides no longer use Slidev. They are the viewer's own slides page: each section a slide on a canvas of a fixed size (980 wide and 16:9 unless `renderers.slides` says otherwise), drawn in the Book layout and scaled as a whole, from the same prebuilt viewer app as the web form. A section's `{hints} slides:` takes `layout` (`default`, `cover`, `center`, `full`), `class` and `zoom`.
  
  - `presmium build --to slides` takes about 2 s for a lecture; `presmium dev --to slides` and the workbench's slides preview are the viewer's page with `?form=slides` (a switch from the document to the slides in the workbench takes about 0.15 s), and an edit reaches the slide as the sections it changed.
  - The exports print that page in Chromium (`playwright-chromium`, an optional peer of `@lincyaw/render-slides`): `pdf`, `png` (a picture of each slide, or of each step) and `pptx` (a picture of each slide, its narration as the speaker notes, with `pptxgenjs`). `presmium-export` and `presmium-diff` use them; `presmium-export` no longer takes `--wait`, since the page tells when it is ready.
  - The exporters' context builds a renderer's output (`ExportContext.build`, in place of `prepare`) and carries the asker's `options`; the compiler's `exportDocument` runs an exporter, for the workspace's jobs and for the command line.
  - Removed: `@lincyaw/addon-core` (the slides' host adapter; a headmatter that still lists it compiles, with a note), every plugin's `setup/` and Slidev layers, the plugins' `vitePlugins` (a plugin's `vite.config.ts` gives the viewer app's build its Vite plugins and Vue's `isCustomElement`), `Renderer.prepare`, `RenderContext.vitePlugins`, the host's `PmStepScope`, the kernel's `servedAssets`, `prebundleDependencies`, `warmDevPage` and `linkBrowserDependencies`, the publish addon's PWA build of the slides, and the slides' themes.
  - The presenter draws on the slides (`d`, or the pen in the presentation's bar: four inks, the eraser, undo, clear) with drauu: each slide's drawing is shared between the presenter's and the audience's windows and the classroom, and kept in the document's `.presmium/drawings/` while a server serves the page (`@lincyaw/addon-stage`). Viewer plugins can put layers on each slide (`scope: 'slide'`) and controls in the presentation's bar (`scope: 'bar'`).
  - A runnable code block can be edited in place before it runs (CodeMirror 6, loaded the first time a block is edited; Mod-Enter runs), and restored, in the pages and the slides alike.

### Patch Changes

- f8606cc: Reuse up to two loaded web preview windows when switching lectures. Inactive previews unmount document components, stop their runtime and control stream, and expire after two minutes. Resume refreshes the published IR without reloading JavaScript. Unsupported previews, changed runtime configurations, and plugins without an explicit restartable lifecycle fall back to reloading.
  
  Add optional preview activity commands and acknowledgements. Browser module packages must opt in with `presmium.preview.restartable` and kernel plugins with `PluginDefinition.restartable`, promising complete disposal followed by setup in the same window. Core and content opt in; other sources default to reloading.
  
  Validate unchanged IR snapshots with ETags and reuse a bounded cache of parsed workbench IR, avoiding repeated transfers and parsing while still checking the current revision on each request.
  
  Coalesce concurrent IR reads, revalidate saves that arrive during an earlier read, and memoize pure Markdown HAST within a bounded cache. Mounted components and background resources are never retained by this data cache.
- abc191d: 切换幻灯片、到达块的 until 步骤或卸载组件时暂停视频和音频，避免隐藏的媒体继续播放；总览与下一页预览不自动播放。返回后保留手动控制，仅在仍启用自动播放时恢复中断的自动播放，网页阅读时仍可自行控制屏幕外的音频。宿主新增 useBlockStepRange，提供父子块显示范围的交集而不改变原有步骤偏移。
- a9325fe: 读者、讲者看到的界面文字按界面术语与文案规范（docs/glossary.md）统一：演示者视图、观众视图、结束放映、讲稿与配音、撤消、更新（不再显示“重新编译”）、网页视图；en 的命令、窗格与视图用 Title Case，消息与字段用 sentence case，弯引号与美式拼写（Canceled）。启动报告、对话框的“关闭”、站点启动失败与审批失败的提示改为目录文本；读者问答按共享的界面语言规则（`currentLocale()`）告诉模型用哪种语言回答；Notebook 中的终端说明、手动字幕过期提示、配音试听文字按文稿的 `lang` 取自目录。
- 2f13757: Bind Markmap's public text-color variable to the shared foreground token with enough specificity to survive its injected defaults, keeping mind-map labels readable in both appearance modes.
- 3f4442a: Name the classroom's and the other plugins' public API after what each name does, and move the demonstration components out of the published plugins. Old name to new name:
  
  - `@lincyaw/addon-classroom`:
    - The classroom store's records name the right options of a quiz `correct` (`QuizState`, `QuizSource` and the `PmQuiz` prop, which was `answer`), the asker of a question `participant` (was `author`) and the component a record belongs to `quizId`, `pulseId`, `predictId`, `exerciseId` (were `quiz`, `pulse`, `predict`, `exercise`). Records that earlier versions wrote are still read. A deck that writes `{component} PmQuiz` with an `answer` prop passes `correct` instead; `{quiz}` is unchanged.
    - `isAnswer`, `isQuizState`, `isPulseVote`, `isSubmission`, `isQuestion`, `isNote`, `isSavedPrediction`, `isPrediction` to `toAnswer`, `toQuizState`, `toPulseVote`, `toSubmission`, `toQuestion`, `toNote`, `toSavedPrediction`, `toPrediction` (they return the record, or `undefined`); `useCollection` takes such a function.
    - `useSession`, `useNotes`, `useWrite`, `bothStores` to `useParticipation`, `useNoteStore`, `useGuardedWrite`, `layeredStore`; `readersHave`, `isLabel`, `sectionNumbers` to `isForStudents`, `isAuthorLabel`, `toSectionNumbers`; `tally`, `distribution`, `summarize`, `summaryText`, `Tally`, `ExerciseSummary` to `quizTally`, `pulseTally`, `exerciseTally`, `exerciseTallyText`, `QuizTally`, `ExerciseTally`; `QuestionGroup.place` to `label`. New: `classroomRows`, `unansweredCount`, `ClassroomRecords`, `ClassroomRows`. No longer exported: `READERS`, `CHECK_PROGRAM`, `typicalError`.
    - The passes are named `presmium.classroom.places`, `presmium.classroom.predict-reveals` and `presmium.classroom.predict-fallbacks`.
  - `@lincyaw/addon-session`: `createClassroom`, `Classroom`, `ClassroomOptions` to `createClassroomConnection`, `ClassroomConnection`, `ClassroomConnectionOptions`, and its `serve()` to `setServer()`; `useClassroom` to `useClassroomSession`; `started`, `ended`, `cursorOf`, `plain`, `loopbackLink`, `roomId`, `sessionConfig` to `startRecord`, `endRecord`, `clonePosition`, `jsonClone`, `isLoopbackLink`, `readableString`, `toSessionConfig`. `ClassroomSnapshot.presenterPosition`, which nothing read, is removed.
  - `@lincyaw/classroom-server`: `ClassroomServerOptions.host` to `listenAddress`; the command's file is `bin/presmium-classroom-server.mjs` (the command and its `--host` are unchanged).
  - `@lincyaw/addon-publish`: `OFFLINE_MANIFEST`, `OfflineManifest` to `OFFLINE_CACHE_RULES`, `OfflineCacheRules`; `onInBuild`, `publishOptions` to `slidevEnablesInBuild`, `toPublishOptions`. New: `MEDIA_EXTENSIONS`. The pass is named `presmium.publish.remote-assets`.
  - `@lincyaw/addon-core`: the demonstration components `PmDemoStepper`, `PmDemoGreeting`, `PmDemoAnimated`, `PmDemoBroken`, the demonstration plugins (`demoPlugins`, `DEMO_GREETER`, `DEMO_GREETING`, `Greeter`), `wantsDemo`, the `presmium.core.demo` option and the `presmiumPlugins` export are removed (they live in a test plugin of the repository). `sharedOut`, `sharedReceiver`, `slideSectionOf`, `SlideSections.placeOf` to `sharedStateOut`, `createSharedStateIn`, `toSlideSection`, `SlideSections.slideAt`. The pass is named `presmium.core.slide-sections`.
  - `@lincyaw/host`: `pluginsOf(module)` takes no configuration: a plugin module no longer exports `presmiumPlugins(config)`.
  - `@lincyaw/addon-content`: `<presmium-demo-counter>`, `defineDemoElements`, `DEMO_COUNTER_TAG`, `contentPlugin` and the `./client` export are removed. The pass is named `presmium.content.plantuml`.
  - `@lincyaw/addon-code`: `found`, `notFound`, `locate`, `unitRecord`, `codeConfig` to `resolvedAt`, `unresolved`, `lineRange`, `originUnits`, `toCodeConfig`; `Candidate.print` and `Snippet.units` to `Candidate.fingerprint` and `Snippet.regions`. No longer exported: `dedent`, `isRegionMarker`.
  - `@lincyaw/addon-stage`: `STAGE_MESSAGES` to `MESSAGES`, `screenMode` to `toScreenMode`; `./client` no longer re-exports the names of `./domain`. The pass is named `presmium.stage.footnotes`. `StageViewerContext` is removed: the viewer plugin takes `ViewerPluginContext` from `@lincyaw/viewer`, as the guide and session plugins now do too.
- 5485bd0: Coordinate native video and audio with the runtime playback lease, cancel stale starts across navigation and removal, and show readable playback failures while retaining browser controls and timing.
- 6d9ae73: Derive, watch, validate and publish per-step media resources from the canonical parameters. Keep video, audio, poster, caption and animation step overrides aligned with their published URLs when navigating in any order.
