# @lincyaw/addon-exec-local

Running code in a local container built from the repository's devcontainer definition, and exporting the environment.

Part of [Presmium](https://github.com/Lincyaw/presmium), which compiles canonical lecture.json teaching documents into web pages, slides, Jupyter notebooks and narrated playback.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add -D @lincyaw/addon-exec-local
```

Add this package to `metadata.plugins` in the document's `lecture.json`.

It is a Presmium plugin: its components work on the web page and in the slides. It needs `@lincyaw/cli` and the renderers in the same project, and declares the Presmium packages it shares with them as peer dependencies (Presmium 1.x).

## What it provides

- Code components that run in the repository's devcontainer (with Docker and `presmium dev`), and export their code with the declared environment.
- Named environments of `kind: devcontainer` in `execute.environments`.

It needs Docker on the machine that builds or presents.
